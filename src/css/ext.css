  PROBLEM
  the top navigation bar moves around on the page when printed
  this blocks important information, especially in
  articles written for brevity

  SOLUTION
  hide the top navigation to prevent it from blocking important text

*/
@media print {
  /* hides the navigation bar and mdn article actions bar */
  header.top-navigation, div.article-actions-container {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
